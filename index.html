Animated Creature
        

    
    </h1>
      <p>This is my three eyed insect (most likely an ant) and he's roaming around on a golf course. He has some antennae on his head that start blue and end up as red. He also has some sharp teeth, and only four legs. He doesn't really have much of a purpose more just living life and observing it with the third eye he's been gifted. He's an interesting creature, I bet his third eye gives him super powers. </p>
